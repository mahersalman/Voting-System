# Blockchain-Based Voting System

## Deployment on Vercel

You can view a live example of this project deployed on Vercel here: [Blockchain Voting System Example](https://temp....)

Follow the instructions below to deploy your own instance.

## Overview

This project involves the development of a blockchain-based voting system designed to ensure secure, transparent, and privacy-focused voting processes. The system utilizes Ethereum smart contracts for managing voting securely and immutably, providing real-time updates and robust voter authentication.

## Key Features

- **Privacy and Security**: Enhanced through blockchainâ€™s decentralized architecture.
- **Transparency**: Immutable smart contracts ensure integrity and trust.
- **Real-Time Updates**: Dynamic tracking of voting progress and results.

## Technology Stack

- **Smart Contract Implementation**: Solidity
- **Frontend Development**: TypeScript, React.js, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend Development**: Next.js
- **Deployment**: Ethereum testnet: Sepolia

This system reflects a modern approach to leveraging blockchain technology for privacy-centric and secure solutions.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to clone the project, deploy the smart contract, and run the application.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Node.js (v14+)
- npm or yarn
- Hardhat (for smart contract deployment)
- Ethereum wallet (e.g., MetaMask)

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd blockchain-voting-system
```

### Install Dependencies

Install all required packages using npm:

```bash
npm install
```

### Deploy Smart Contract

1. Add your private key to the `.env` file:

   ```
   PRIVATE_KEY=<your_private_key>
   ``

2. Deploy the `createBallot` smart contract to the Sepolia testnet:

   ```bash
   npm run deploy
   ```

3. Copy the contract address output from the deployment process and paste it into the `.env` file:

   ```
   CONTRACT_ADDRESS=<deployed_contract_address>
   ```

### Run the Application

Start the Next.js development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to view the application.

## Project Architecture

### Frontend

- Built with React.js and TypeScript.
- Styled using Tailwind CSS for a clean and responsive design.

### Backend

- Built with the Next.js framework for seamless server-side rendering and API integration.

### Blockchain Integration

- Smart contracts deployed on the Ethereum Sepolia testnet.
- Wallet connection and interactions handled using Reown API.
