Blockchain-Based Voting System

Overview:

This project involves the development of a blockchain-based voting system designed to ensure secure, transparent, and privacy-focused voting processes. The system utilizes Ethereum smart contracts for managing voting securely and immutably, providing real-time updates and robust voter authentication.

Key Features:
	•	Privacy and Security: Enhanced through blockchain’s decentralized architecture.
	•	Transparency: Immutable smart contracts ensure integrity and trust.
	•	Real-Time Updates: Dynamic tracking of voting progress and results.

Technology Stack:
	•	Smart Contract Implementation: Solidity
	•	Frontend Development: HTML, JavaScript, TypeScript, React.js, Tailwind CSS
	•	Backend Development: Next.js, Node.js, MongoDB
	•	Deployment: Ethereum testnets (Goerli, Sepolia, or MoreThanWallet) or the Ethereum Mainnet

This system reflects a modern approach to leveraging blockchain technology for privacy-centric and secure solutions.
